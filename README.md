Rails Backend loosely based on the allegorical novella by George Orwell, 'Animal Farm.' Useful for practicing Fetch, DOM Manipulation, Events etc. As of now, API is read-only. POST, PATCH, DELETE actions coming soon! 

To start: 
  ```
     $ rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
     $ rails s ** -p 3001 ** 
     (add the last two arguments if you wish to run on a different port - which you may if you plan on        
     building out the front-end with React!) 
  ```
     
Thanks!
